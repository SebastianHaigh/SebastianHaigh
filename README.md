### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at Nokia, previously a Computer Science researcher at the University of South Wales.

I'm currently trying to gain a deeper understanding of distributed systems and am open to contributing to any projects related to that.

I'm also interested in chess programming.

My primary language is C++.
